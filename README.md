# SoccerHeads
SoccerHeads is a 2D multiplayer, 1v1 soccer (football) game, where each player is a blob (representing a human head) with one foot.
This is a school project managed by @DarioLoll and @RaminKasumov.

## Background:
More and more students can't or don't want to invest too much time in games. 
At the same time, there is a lack of mini online games that can be played at any time without wasting too much of it. 
Therefore, we have chosen a simple but entertaining soccer game that can be played at any time with friends or strangers over the network.

## Goals:
- Fun, enjoyable to play
- Responsive controls
- Smooth gameplay
- Low latency
- Playable through an app
- Playable on a website

## Non-goals (presently):
- Having real football players as selectable characters
- A single player mode where the opponent is an A.I.
- Beautiful graphics

## Used resources:
- Unity Engine
- Unity Gaming Services:
  - Authentication Service
  - Lobby Service
  - Relay Server
  - NetCode for GameObjects
- GIMP
- XAMMP
