# SoccerHeads
SoccerHeads is a 2D multiplayer, 1v1 soccer (football) game, where each player is a blob (representing a human head) with one foot.
This is a school project managed by @DarioLoll and @RaminKasumov.

## Background:
More and more students can't or don't want to invest too much time in games. 
At the same time, there is a lack of mini online games that can be played at any time without wasting too much of it. 
Therefore, we have chosen a simple but entertaining soccer game that can be played at any time with friends or strangers over the network.

## Planned Outcome:
The successful development of an engaging soccer game with low latency, responsive controls, and smooth gameplay. It may be playable at any time on a website or through an app.
