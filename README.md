## Background:
Engineering games like Factorio, and modded Minecraft are highly addictive, and for a good reason. When playing such games, one is constantly encountered with various problems that require problem-solving skills. We are of the belief that engineering games help in evolving one's problem-solving skills while also familiarizing one with topics in real-life enginnering like automation, logistics, optimization and efficiency (bottle necks, centralization vs on-site...). This is why we decided to make an engineering game!

## Goals:
- Fun, enjoyable to play
- Responsive controls
- Smooth gameplay
- Low latency
- Playable through an app
- Not too hard to learn to play
- Not too easy to complete

## Non-goals (presently):
- Beautiful graphics
- Sandbox game

## Used resources:
- Unity Engine
- Unity Gaming Services:
  - Authentication Service
  - Lobby Service
  - Relay Server
  - NetCode for GameObjects
- Blender
- GIMP
