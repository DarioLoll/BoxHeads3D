# BoxHeads 3D
Box Heads is a first person, 3D multiplayer game where players try to survive in a zombie apocalypse by fending off zombies with guns
The game is still in the planning phase...
This is a school project managed by @DarioLoll and @RaminKasumov.

## Background:
More and more students can't or don't want to invest too much time in games. 
At the same time, there is a lack of mini online games that can be played at any time without wasting too much of it. 
Therefore, we have chosen a simple but entertaining shooter game that can be played at any time with friends or strangers over the network.

## Goals:
- Fun, enjoyable to play
- Responsive controls
- Smooth gameplay
- Low latency
- Playable through an app
- Difficulties to choose from
- Endless game mode

## Non-goals (presently):
- Beautiful graphics
- PvP (Player versus Player game mode)
- A lot of weapon types
- A lot of zombie types

## Used resources:
- Unity Engine
- Unity Gaming Services:
  - Authentication Service
  - Lobby Service
  - Relay Server
  - NetCode for GameObjects
- Blender
- GIMP
- XAMMP
